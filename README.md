# 👋 Hi I'm Kiran BK!

I'm a Honors CS student @ UMass Amherst interested in building production-ready AI/ML applications and the cloud infrastructure that powers them.


🔭 I’m working as a **Software Developer Intern** @ Alterea and currently building **dopamine drop** (a gamification web application + browser for Canvas assignments)

🌱 I'm diving deep into neural network architectures and mastering AWS cloud patterns!

🛠️ Python, Java, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, AWS (Lambda, S3), TensorFlow, PyTorch

💬 Ask me about Manchester City and soccer! I also enjoy watching the NBA, cricket, and playing video games.
