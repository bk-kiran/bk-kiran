## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi! I'm Kiran, a junior Honors Computer Science major at UMass Amherst, focused on building intelligent, end-to-end systems across full-stack engineering, NLP/LLMs, and data science.

I'm passionate about engineering applications that solve real-world problems from building messaging infrastructure and dynamic UIs @ Zyntro.io, to uncovering infection control trends from 50k+ hospital records @ TruBridge. I also previously conducted research at the BioNLP Lab @ UMass, where I fine-tuned clinical LLMs to support medical decision-making.

I’m driven by clean software design, practical AI/ML, and building tools that make a real societal impact.
